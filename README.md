### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am Pravunath Singh! When I'm not building stuff for the web or not trying to connect 'things' over the 'internet' or trying to learn how machines learn..
I'm either looking up at alien mysteries or trying to learn why our universe works the way it does or getting lost in some other parallel universe thanks to my books.
